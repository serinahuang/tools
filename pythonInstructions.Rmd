## Setup
Python—like C, Java, and R—is a programming language. It has seen many developments and the most recent version of Python is Python 3. The grabAbstracts.py script has to be run in Python3.

All Macs come with Python 2 preinstalled. You can check this by typing the following in the Terminal application on your laptop and pressing Enter:
```{bash}
python --version
```

If the output isn't Python 3 followed by some numbers, you'll need to install Python 3 from its [official website] (https://www.python.org/downloads/). You can check if Python 3 is correctly installed by typing: `python3 --version`.

Now that you have Python 3 installed, there are two basic ways to run Python:

#### 1. Interactive mode
You can use interactive mode by entering `python3` in Terminal. You can try some simple calculations in this mode, e.g. enter `1+1` and see what happens. To quit interactive mode, enter `quit()`. Interactive mode is helpful when you need to debug and see results immediately.

#### 2. Script via the command line
Just like how we usually save our documents on Word, it is good practice to save your scripts if you think you'll need to modify them or run them in the future. To run a Python script (denoted by a .py extension), enter the following in your Terminal:
```{bash eval=FALSE}
python3 filename.py
```

## Execution
Now we have our machines set up to run Python, let's try the attachment in my email, `grabAbstracts.py`.

In Terminal, type:
```{bash eval=FALSE}
python3 grabAbstracts.py
```

If you see an error saying "No such file or directory", you have to change your directory to where the Python script is located. In other words, even though you know you saved the Python scripts in the Downloads folder, the Python interpreter doesn't. To tell Python to navigate to that folder, use `cd`. For example: `cd ~/Downloads`, in which the tilde `~` denotes the home directory, which is where your computer uses as the default folder.

You'll probably get another error called "ModuleNotFoundError". This is because the script uses a library/package called [pandas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandas_(software)) that must be installed beforehand. But to install it, you need to first download [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/), Python's package installer. After pip is downloaded, enter `pip3 install pandas` in Terminal.

This script should download an Excel file named "query.xlsx" on your laptop.
